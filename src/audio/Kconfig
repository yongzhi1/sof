config COMP_SRC_STD
	bool "Full conversions support and high quality"
	help
	  This coefficients set supports a large number of conversions
	  with 8 - 192 kHz input and 8 - 48 kHz output. The coefficients
	  are 32 bits for high conversion quality. The coefficients
	  storage consume 79 kB. The runtime needs 8 kB. Use this if there
	  is critical quality usage for SRC like music via headphones and
	  need high sample rates.

config COMP_SRC_SMALL
	bool "Smaller conversions support and high quality"
	help
	  This coefficients set supports a small number of conversions
	  with 8 - 48 kHz input and output. The coefficients are 32 bits
	  for high conversion quality. The coefficients storage consumes
	  30 kB RAM. Runtime needs 4 kB. Use this if there is critical
	  quality usage for SRC like music via headphones.

config COMP_SRC_TINY
	bool "Reduced conversions support and reduced quality"
	help
	  This coefficients set supports a minimum number of conversions
	  with 8 - 48 kHz input and output. The coefficients are 16 bits
	  that restricts the possible stop-attenuation and could cause
	  some audible aliasing. The bandwidth of the filters is restricted
	  so the full 20 kHz band is not met even if sample rate would
	  allow. The coefficients storage consumes 5 kB RAM. The runtime
	  needs 6 kB. Use this to save RAM for other applications when SRC
	  has no critical usage or when only need with lower quality
	  endpoint like miniature speakers.

config MATH_FIR
	bool "FIR filter library"
	default n
	help
	  This option builds FIR (Finite Impulse Response) filter library. It
	  is selected by components for their digital signal processing. A FIR
	  filter calculates a convolution of input PCM sample and a configurable
	  impulse response.


config COMP_FIR
	bool "FIR component"
	select MATH_FIR
	default y
	help
	  Select for FIR component. FIR performance can differ between DSP
	  ISA and compiler used. FIR will perform best when MAC instructions
	  are available in ISA and are used by the compiler. i.e. xt-xcc on
	  xtensa will generate MAC instructions but GCC on xtensa won't.
	  Filter tap count can be severely restricted to reduce FIR cycles
	  and FIR performance for DSP/compilers with no MAC support

	  This component protect the speaker from overheating and
	  excursion violation. This consists of two parts which are
	  feedforward processing block running on playback thread and
	  feedback processing block running on capture thread with
	  amp current and voltage feedback.

config COMP_ASRC
	bool "ASRC component"
	default y
	help
	  Select for Asynchronous sample rate conversion (ASRC)
	  component. The ASRC has the capabilities of (synchronous)
	  SRC but can in addition track a slave DAI that is not in
	  sync with firmware timer. The ASRC can be setup for
	  synchronous operation without DAI tracking via topology
	  though it has a bit higher computational load than SRC. The
	  RAM footprint of ASRC is smaller than SRC because it does
	  not have pre-computed filter coefficients for every
	  conversion fraction that SRC does.

	  This option enables all supported downsampling conversions
	  for the asynchronous sample rate conversion. All the
	  upsampling conversions use the same filter always enabled
	  coefficients set so there is no configuration options for
	  them. The enabled conversions consume about 18 kB of memory.

config COMP_ASRC_DOWNSAMPLING_CUSTOM
	bool "Custom downsampling conversions support"
	help
	  This option used to manually select each downsampling ratio.
	  In order to optimize the text code size of the sample rate
	  converter, non-required conversion ratios can be
	  deactivated.  Disregarding these settings, the sample rate
	  converter always supports all conversion ratios with fs_in
	  less or equal to fs_out. Therefore, it is possible to
	  deactivate all conversion ratios listed below, if we only
	  need an (asynchronous) 1:1 sample rate conversion, e.g, from
	  16 kHz to 16 kHz. This option allows to trim down the coefficient
	  memory for conversion down from default 18 kB. Each conversion
	  needs about 2 kB.
